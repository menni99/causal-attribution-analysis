# Olist E-commerce Causal Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to investigate the causal effect of delayed delivery on customer satisfaction ratings in e-commerce, using data provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces.

### About Olist and the Dataset

Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to various channels through a single contract. Merchants can sell their products via the Olist Store and ship them directly to customers using Olist's logistics partners. The dataset captures the customer journey from purchase to delivery and feedback.

### Research Question

Our primary research question is:

**What is the causal effect of delayed delivery on customer satisfaction ratings in e-commerce?**

Following this, we will conduct a root-cause analysis to understand the factors contributing to delivery delays.

## Methodology

Our analysis will follow these key steps:

1. **Model Formulation**: Develop a causal inference model based on carefully considered assumptions.
2. **Causal Estimand Identification**: Determine an expression for the causal effect under our model assumptions.
3. **Statistical Estimation**: Apply advanced statistical methods such as matching or instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect.
4. **Robustness Checks**: Verify the validity of our estimates through various robustness checks.

## Expected Outcomes

This project aims to provide valuable insights into:
- The quantitative impact of delivery delays on customer satisfaction
- Key factors contributing to delivery delays in e-commerce
- Potential strategies for improving customer satisfaction in online retail

By leveraging causal inference techniques, we hope to move beyond mere correlation and uncover actionable insights for e-commerce businesses.

## Tools and Technologies

Python, DoWhy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/causal-attribution-analysis.git
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with the actual username or organization name where the repository is hosted.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd causal-attribution-analysis
   ```

### Setting up the Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     python3 
     ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt).

2. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will install all necessary dependencies for the project.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
```
deactivate
```
